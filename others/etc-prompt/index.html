EDUCATION HISTORY 2021 - 2025 Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BS InfoTech) Laguna State Polytechnic University - San Pablo City (LSPU - SPC) Specialized in Web and Mobile App Development

WORK EXPERIENCE February 2025 – May 2025 Pixel8 Web Solutions & Consultancy Inc. - System Analyst Intern Authored and co-authored 40+ pages of technical documentation and setup guides, including benchmarking checklists, module overviews, and system implementation steps. Developed 10+ detailed user flow analyses and 185+ form input frameworks, ensuring accurate system processes and consistent UX across modules. Created 100+ pages of UI mockups and process flows in Figma for multiple user types, supporting design clarity and user adoption. Documented 14–15 module features per system, including acceptance criteria for 24 user stories, strengthening structured QA and system validation. Conducted 7 pages of government process documentation for PFMS system compliance, improving analysis accuracy and reporting workflows. Contributed across three major systems: Retail Inventory System, Performance & Feedback Evaluation System, and Rewards & Recognition System. Performed testing and initial QA validations aligned with acceptance criteria and documented workflows.
(PS. the work experience has nothing to do with quality assurance, just a system analyst, be sure to be honest about it)
PROJECTS API Automation & Contract Testing (Shift-Left QA): Designed and implemented a high-speed API Automation suite using Playwright Test Runner to validate the OpenWeatherMap API, the core data source. Executed Contract Testing, Boundary Testing (for input limits), and Security Testing (401 Unauthorized check) across 6 critical scenarios. Achieved a Shift-Left QA capability, confirming data integrity and preventing integration defects before UI deployment. Tools: API Testing, Playwright, Software System Analysis, Git. End-to-End (E2E) UI Automation & CI/CD: Built a reliable E2E Regression Suite using Playwright (Node.js) covering 5 atomic test cases (e.g., input validation, state management). Applied Gray Box Testing techniques via Playwright's API to ensure tests start from a clean state (clearing localStorage). Implemented a Continuous Integration (CI) workflow using GitHub Actions to automate test execution on code pushes, providing immediate feedback on application stability. Tools: Test Automation, Playwright, Continuous Integration (CI), JavaScript. Exploratory Testing & Defect Analysis: Conducted Exploratory Testing and Session-Based Manual Testing to uncover non-obvious defects related to user input, data normalization, and state management. Identified 4 critical/high-priority defects, including a Critical Data Integrity Flaw (duplicate recent searches due to casing) and a High-Priority Security Flaw (insecure HTTP protocol for icons). Validated remediation, leading to enhanced user experience and application security. Tools: Exploratory Testing, Manual Testing, Defect Reporting, Chrome DevTools.
